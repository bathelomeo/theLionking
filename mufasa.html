        <h3>Mufasa 1</h3>
        <p>
        Mufasa is Simba's father.
            Mufasa is Scar's older brother.
            The previous king of the Pride Lands.
            Mufasa taught Simba how past kings live in the stars.
            That they would always be there to guide him in times of need.
            After his death, Scar convinced Simba to run away and never return.
            Scar then told the other lions that both Mufasa and Simba had died in the stampede.
            Allowing him to take control of the Pride Lands as its new king.
            Later, Mufasa appeared to Simba as a spirit to enlighten Simba's courage to take his role as the Pride Land's true king by usurping Scar's leadership.
            Mufasa originally appeared in the 1994 film.

            He saves Simba and Nala from being killed by Shenzi.
            He saves Simba and Nala from being killed by Banzai.

         It parts on the right side of the top of his head, not unlike human hair.
            Mufasa's eyes are red and his sclera are yellow.
            while his eyebrows are black. 
            His ears are just barely visible poking through his mane.
            He has ten dark-colored whiskers.
            After saving Simba, Scar stabs Mufasa's paws.
            To make him fall down.
            From a cliff.
            Into the stampede.
            where he is killed.

         five on either side of his upper lip.
            There is a tuft of reddish brown fur on the tip of his tail.
            When Simba was a small cub, Mufasa came to Wildebeest Gorge to save him from being crushed by stampeding wildebeests.
            Although he saved Simba, he had to climb a cliff to exit the gorge.
            When he got to the top, he was tossed off the cliff by his own brother, Scar, and crushed by the stampede down below.
            by the wildebeest.
            The voice for Mufasa in Kingdom Hearts II was composed.
            Archived voice recordings.
            From The Lion King.
            Mufasa never thought of himslef.
