            Simba is a gentle father.
            His childs name is kiara<strong>she a girl</strong>
            Did you know scar never sucided in killing simba bacause he killed mufasa instead and told simba to run because he was the future king.
            Did you know simba is the son of mufasa.
            Then when simba ran <strong>(After scar banished him) when he was a child</strong> pumbaa and timon took care of him like he was their son.
            Then mufasa's friend rafiki friend rafiki came and encouraged him to chalenge scar and take back his throne.
            All i can say is that kiara is lucky to have such a gentle father <strong>bacause she got into alot of trouble</strong>.
            Simba was also a Iresbonsible child.
